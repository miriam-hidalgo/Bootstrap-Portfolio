            <p>My name is Miriam Hidalgo. I was originally born in the Dominican Republic and was brought to the US when I was 7 months old. I grew up in West New York, NJ. I went to school there all my life until I went to Rutgers University in New Brunswick. There I majored in Psychology and double minored in Sociology & Criminology.</p>

            <p>I used to work at a computer lab in college and it has been my favorite job. Being around computers and performing hardware & software troubleshooting for students was very enjoyable for me. I always wanted to enter the tech world but I held myself back thinking it was no place for me. Even though my career went into the path of social services, I have continued to be intrigued by how things work and are designed. With learning that there are now so many ways to learn coding, I had to try getting into the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. Now that I am in it, I feel the confidence to pursue what I thought was once impossible to learn.</p>
